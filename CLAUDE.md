# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

hledger-app is a desktop application for viewing hledger reports and charts. It uses hledger-lib (Rust) to interact with the hledger CLI tool and presents the data through a Tauri/React UI.

## Commands

### Development

```bash
# Change to app directory
cd app

# Install dependencies
bun install
# ALWAYS use bun, NOT npm
# ALWAYS use bunx instead of npx for running packages

# Start development with hot-reload
bun run tauri:dev
# NOTE: Do not run this command - it's always running in a separate terminal window

# Build for production
bun run tauri:build

# Run linting
bun run lint

# Format code with Biome (run after completing tasks)
bun run format
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests for hledger-lib
cd hledger-lib
cargo test

# Generate TypeScript bindings from Rust
cd hledger-lib
cargo test export_bindings
```

## Architecture

### Project Structure

- **app/** - The Tauri desktop application (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
  - **src/** - React frontend code
  - **src-tauri/** - Rust backend code for Tauri
  
- **hledger-lib/** - Rust library that interfaces with the hledger CLI
  - **src/commands/** - Implementations of hledger commands
  - **bindings/** - Generated TypeScript type definitions

### Data Flow

1. **User Interface (React)** - The UI allows users to configure options and request data
2. **Tauri Bridge** - Commands from the UI are passed to the Rust backend via Tauri
3. **hledger-lib** - The Rust library constructs and executes hledger CLI commands
4. **Command Execution** - The library executes hledger CLI commands and parses results
5. **Results** - Data flows back through Tauri to be displayed in the UI

### Type Generation

The project uses `ts-rs` to generate TypeScript types from Rust structs:

1. Add `#[derive(TS)]` and `#[ts(export)]` to Rust structs
2. Run `cargo test export_bindings` to generate TypeScript files
3. Import and re-export types in `app/src/types/hledger.types.ts`

## Code Quality

### Formatting

This project uses Biome for code formatting with a line width of 120 characters. **ALWAYS run formatting after completing any task that modifies TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON files:**

```bash
cd app
bun run format
```

For Rust code formatting:

```bash
cd hledger-lib
cargo fmt

cd app/src-tauri
cargo fmt
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding New hledger Commands

1. Create a new module in `hledger-lib/src/commands/`
2. Implement the command with appropriate options struct
3. Add `#[derive(TS)]` and `#[ts(export)]` to the options struct
4. Expose the command via `hledger-lib/src/lib.rs`
5. Generate TypeScript bindings and update imports
6. Add a Tauri command in `app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
7. Create UI components to use the new command

### Adding UI Components

To add shadcn/ui components:

```bash
cd app
bunx shadcn@latest add component-name
# For example:
bunx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Memories

- **Date Range Handling**: hledger treats begin dates as inclusive but end dates as exclusive (transactions before the end date). However, users expect both start and end dates to be inclusive in the UI. Therefore, when passing date ranges from the frontend to hledger commands, add 1 day to the end date to make it inclusive for users. Example: user selects May 1-5 â†’ send begin=May 1, end=May 6 to hledger

- **Journal File Management**: The app uses a built-in file picker with persistent storage (tauri-plugin-store). Files are stored in `journal-files.json` with the structure: `{"journalFiles": ["path1", "path2"], "lastSelectedJournalFile": "path1"}`. The `select_journal_files` Tauri command opens a file dialog, and the frontend manages the file list and selection state.
